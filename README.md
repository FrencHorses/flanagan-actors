A visualisation of actor appearances in Mike Flanagan's horror titles.

Have you been enjoying some spooky season vibes, watched several haunted houses and adjacent horror drama, and suddenly wondered why many of the same faces kept showing up?

To create this visualisation, I first spent some time wrangling the source data from IMDb in Python, and then designed the final product in Tableau.
